	/**
	 * @help: "setup" is the method called when MediaWiki reaches the 
	 * "ParserFirstCallInit" hook. 
	 *
	 * A method is what you call a function that is part of a class. A class
	 * is the definition of an object. So you create a class, then in code you
	 * create instances of that class...those instances are called objects.
	 *
	 * This method is defined as "static", which means you don't actually have to
	 * create an object (an instance of the class) to call the method. 
	 *
	 * The way this class "SumTimes" is used, I don't believe you'll ever actually
	 * create an object. You'll purely be using static methods. The reason for
	 * creating a class in this case is to compartmentalize the code...so you can
	 * have a method called "setup" in SumTimes, and I can have a method called 
	 * the same thing in CopyWatchers
	 *
	 * The only argument (parameter) passed to "setup" is $parser. This is passed to all
	 * functions using the "ParserFirstCallInit" hook, and it is a reference to the parser
	 * object which you can read more about here:
	 * https://doc.wikimedia.org/mediawiki-core/master/php/html/classParser.html
	 *
	 * Right before the $parser argument there is an "&". This means the $parser
	 * object is being "passed by reference" as opposed to "passed by value". 
	 * You can look up those terms to find out what they mean, but passed
	 * by reference means that any changes you make to the $parser object will
	 * affect the $parser object throughout the entire application.

		 * "defined()" is checking if the class of $parser has the property 
		 * "SFH_OBJECT_ARGS" defined.

		 * SFH_OBJECT_ARGS is defined, then the MW version is newer, and you can 
		 * used a "better" way of coding.
